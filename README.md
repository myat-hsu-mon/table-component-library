# Table Component Library

This project is a React-based table component library with Storybook for convenient development and testing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project locally and provide information on running, testing, and building the components.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:myat-hsu-mon/table-component-library.git
```

OR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/myat-hsu-mon/table-component-library.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd table-component-library
```

### Development Mode

To install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Testing

To launch the test runner in interactive watch mode:

```bash
npm test
```

### Production Build

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.

## Running with Storybook

To run the project outside of the React project with isolation:

### Storybook

```bash
npm run storybook

After running this command, access [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to explore the components and test them with different attributes.
